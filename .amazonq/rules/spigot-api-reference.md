# Spigot API Reference Rule

When working on the Ollivanders2 Minecraft plugin, reference the local Spigot API documentation located at:
`~/minecraft/Spigot/Spigot-API/target/apidocs/`

This documentation should be consulted for:
- Bukkit/Spigot API classes and methods
- Entity handling and manipulation
- Event system implementation
- Location and world operations
- Player and server interactions

Always verify API usage against this local documentation to ensure compatibility with the current Spigot version.
